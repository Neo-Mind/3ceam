	  Has taken this info as true according with the info taken by packets directly in the RE server.
	
	
	== Misc Update ==
	* Fix a bug in the function that calculates the skill tree. If you was 3rd Job you could level up yours 3rd job skills without raising your 1st and/or 2nd skills points.
	- Was added a new variable "jobchange_level2" as a global_reg_value to store the job lvl at which you change to 3rd job. This variable was added modifing the previous sd->status.change_level
	  as an array with two index. change_level[0] stores the job level at which you change to 2nd job and change_level[1] stores the job level at which you change to 3rd job.
	* Inproved the status change system.
	- The old sc_start, sc_start2 and sc_start4 have reverted to the old system and shouldn't include type2. In these macros the type2 is assumed as 0. And we don't need modifie the new sc_starts added by eA.
	- Added two new macros, sc_start5 and sc_start7 to uses SC that need to use type2 (sc_start5) and the new 2 fields founds in the packet 0x43f used with WL_READING_SB that hold the skill lvl to use and the spell points used.
	- Change type2 for val5 and added val6 and val7 in the sc structures and added support for it.
	- Added two new sql files in the sql_folder to update the mysql and modified the main.sql file.

	NOTE: This changes are working as i could see, if you find some problem or if you have some question, pls tell me.

	* Changed Windmill's damage formula to 100 * SkillLV%. (Unofficial)
	== Misc Updates ==
	* Finished most of the 29/07/2009 update. The only things  missing are:
	- Updates to Enchant Blade, Nathuz being usable during Deep Sleep (and cancelling Deep Sleep), Rune Mastery updates, Dragon Training updates.
	* Fixed many merging errors as a followup to r93. Sorry guys, I rushed when committing >_<.
	== Formula Updates ==
	* Reviewed all skill damage formulas and found some very interesting results. Many skills had their formulas wrong, and all of the MinWand, Shadow Chaser, and Shura skills
		actually had their damage formulas being 1/10 of the original skill multiplier.
	- printf is your friend :). To test their formulas I used printf("Skillratio = %d\n", skillratio);. In fact, I use it all the time when something
		goes wrong, it helps me find out at what line map-server crashes, for example. ;)
	== Notes ==
	* Oh yeah, I forgot to say that in r93 I also committed what I believe is the official mado system. In this new version you'll have a "cooling"
		counter, which will decrease by one every time you attack or use a (targetted) skill. When it reaches 0, you'll overheat, and this status
		can only be removed upon death (using a mado) or using the skill Emergency Cooling. However for whatever reason the counter isn't working
		properly, it goes down quicker than it should. Anyway, Overheat is also causing you to stop casting a skill when you get hit, so it's
		still kinda buggy.

	* Changes to Manhole:

	== Code Fix/CleanUp ==
	* Fixed Oratio not working.
	* Fixed a map-server crash caused by Adoramus when used by monsters.
	- Missing sd check.
	* Fixed a nullpo error when retrieving an unexistant sd at skill_blockpc_start, that was being caused by the skill cooldown system.
	- Missing sd check.
	* Fixed Ancilla working even when you have more than three ancillas in your inventory.
	- TODO: When it says you can't have more than three ancillas, does it mean that you cannot have more than three ancillas in your inventory AT ALL
		or that you just can't make more when you have three already?
	* Added several missing sd checks on Reading Spellbook's code.
	* Added a missing sd check on Earth Strain.

	- 330 (Blue circle over char's head) = Oratio (Arch Bishop).
	- Info retrieved from: "Videocast - Guillotine Cross e Ranger em Ash Vaccuum". Sorry, I lost the link. Just search for it on YouTube.
	== ToDo ==
	* If anyone would be kind enough to make skill_require_db entries for Shura skills and skill_tree entries for Shura and Minstrel/Wanderer,
		it would be great. Personally, I hate doing those and I will leave it to anyone who feels like making them. Of course, if nobody does it,
		eventually I will, but I'm focusing on finish adding all the skills and fixing them right now. ^^
	== Notes ==
	* Oh my God, I hope I payed back for my absense ;).
	- Yes, I just found some time to dedicate to this project, and I made (and tested, so far NO BUGS AT ALL) all the Shura skills in the past three days.
		I'm without a fixed internet connection, since I still didn't finish rearranging my life back in Brazil, but the good news are that I can work offline anyway :P
		No, I don't know when exactly I'll return to my regular (internet) life, but it may take a month, at most. Anyway, I think I'll keep on commiting every once in a while
		all the changes I'm able to make during my free time.
	* I know I should be adding the new SCs to const.txt, but I think it's better to do it only when we finish a class 100%, so we don't have to keep on changing it everytime.
	* And as a final note, I would love to keep myself updated regarding the events that have been happening, so if anyone wouldl mind sending me offline messages (I always read them when I log in) on MSN,
	I would be really thankful :). That is, things that have been happening to and regarding this project.
	* JESUS CHRIST, freaking huge commit O___O.

	== Skill Updates ==
	* Changed Comet to a ground-targetted skill based on this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaPOCWT9d08.
	- However, using UNT_DUMMYSKILL it shows no effect at all, so I had to use clif_specialeffect to send the meteor storm effect
		on every target hit, which is what apparently happens in the video (there is a effect for every target, not a effect on
		the ground cell selected, [which i found stupid, since it's supposed to be only one comet lol]). Anyway, we need some
		packet captures to make sure that's how it's supposed to work.
	* Deep Sleep Lullaby is now a ground skill.
	* Added a check to Harmonize so that it will only work on Players (map-server crashes when it's used on something else).
	* Added Reverberation.
	* Little optimizations to Axe Tornado and Axe Boomerang's damage formulas.
	* Little code clean-up left from old Warlock Spheres system.
	- By the way, ours isn't complete, the spheres are not being deleted, probably just graphically. Anyway, I looked at the code
		and it's kind of confusing, so Pakpil, if you could please finish this little part, it would be really apprecitated. :)

	* Soooooooorry I made a mistake. Please refer to r12's entry in this file for the new complete Changelog.

	r12 [LimitLine]
	== Skill Updates ==
	* Changes to Weapon Blocking:
	- Its effect is shown only in the caster once it is triggered.
	- Now once you successfully block an attack, SC_WEAPONBLOCKING will NOT be ended.
	* Fixed and functional Weapon Crush.
	* Little change to Chain Lightning.
	- There is no point on using a SC to set wether the character is holding a Chain, we can simply add two pointers to map_session_data.
		map_session_data -> chain_counter = Holds the number of chains left.
		map_session_data -> chain_id = Holds the ID of the last target hit.
		If a player uses Chain Lightning when there is still Chains running around, the use of the skill will increase the actual
		number of chains left, instead of starting a new chain.
	- Since 2009-05-27: Chain Lightning will hit the selected target three times if there is no target to chain to.
	- Since 2009-05-27: Comet is not a ensemble skill anymore. However, it costs 2 Red Gemstones to be cast (oh my god, big mistake, Gravity u.u)
	- Since 2009-05-27: Frost Misty and Jack Frost radius is now 13x13.
	- Since 2009-05-27: Tetra Vortex's damage is now 1000% / 1500% / 2000% / 2500% / 3000%.
	- Since 2009-05-27: Stasis' Radius is now 9 / 10 / 11 / 12 / 13
	- Since 2009-05-27: Earth Strain is now a ground-placed skill.
	- Since 2009-05-27: Sienna Execrate's duration is now 6s / 9s / 12s / 15s / 18s.
	- Since 2009-05-27: Renovatio now heals 3% of maxHP.
	== Side Notes ==
	* Just so I won't forget:
		How to handle Stealth Field:
		Add another pointer to map_session_data (yes, I love pointers) called 'stealth'.
		This will hold the unit id which strted Camouflage on the character.
		Since you will lose the Camouflage status once you leave the field, it is safe to assume that the character will be ON
		the unit group when he is under SC_STEALTH.
		So, what do we do to CANCEL Stealth Field?
		Well, basically, when a character steps in a Stealth Field unit group, it will check wether its ID is the SAME as
		'stealth'. If it is not, then we DELETE the unit group in 'stealth', because that means that 2 stealth field units just
		overlapped.
		So it would look somehow like this:
			case NC_STEALTHFIELD:
			if( !sd )
				break;
			if( sd->stealth != sg->group_id )
				DELETE unit group from sd->stealth AND sg->group_id.
			else
				RENEW SC_STEALTH, because apparently there is only one STEALTH FIELD in area.

	r11 [LimitLine]
	== Skill Updates ==
	* Official cast times, delays, cooldowns, etc for the following skills:
		- GC_CROSSIMPACT
		- GC_DARKILLUSION
		- GC_ROLLINGCUTTER
		- GC_CROSSRIPPERSLASHER
		- GC_WEAPONBLOCKING
		- GC_COUNTERSLASH
		- GC_CRUSHSTRIKE -- TODO: Find Divest duration & rate.
	* Fixed Phantom Menace. Now it will only hit those under Hiding Status.
	* Fixed Weapon Blocking. Now you can turn it off.
	* Added ST_ROLLINGCUTTER for Cross Ripper Slasher.
	* Added Bonus for rotation counters on Cross Ripper Slasher's formula.
	* Fixed Soul Expansion & White Imprison.
	* Added SP drain when holding one or more Spell Books.
	* Changed skill Dragon Breath to a single-target Radius skill. Since apparently it is not a ground skill,
		it must be radius (according to Doddler, it is an "Area Skill").
	== Misc Updates ==
	* Made little changes to graphical part of the Balls System. But seriously, I give up working on it, Pakpil seems to have
		developed a way better idea to handle it. :)
	== Formula Updates ==
	* Changed Chain Lightning's formula.
	- It's been quite some time since I don't understand why the damage with Chain Lightning is so high at official servers, and
		I think I found the answer to my question:
		http://ro.doddlercon.com/wiki/index.php?title=Warlock#Chain_Lightning
		The attack formula is right: 400% + 100% * Skill Lv. But then, how come the damage difference was so high on RE?
		I believe the answer to my question is in the "Random Attack" field. The formula may be right, but it seems like targets
		will receive more than one hit from Chain Lightning (even though it only appears as one single hit, and without affecting
		the number of chains left). So please take a look at the new "formula" for Chain Lightning:
		OLD:
		skillratio += 40 + skill_lv;
		NEW:
		skillratio += 40 + skill_lv * 10 * rand()%(skill_lv + 4);
	* Fixed Jobbie's formulas:
	- I got what you tried to do Jobbie, but you forgot that:
		1 = 10%
		10 = 100%
		100 = 1000% and instead used X as X% when X is actually X/10% ^^
	* Updated all formulas according to information on Doddler's website.
	* Fixed all formulas. There was sooooooooooo much stuff wrong about quite a few of them.

	r10 [Jobbie]
	* Fixes to Icebound and Firing Trap
	- skill now is a misc type of attack.
	- Icebound now has SI during status effect
	- Temporary duplicated the damage calcutation from Blastmine.
	* Removed OPT1 Freezing because freezing status is not a non-stackable effect.
	* Temporary commented in the Burning Status Option. Need for further investigation if the status is a non-stackable effect.
	* Fixed Expatio's lvl5 duration being setted to short duration.
	* Fixed losing skills during option change Dragon Riding, Wug Riding and Mado
	* Merging SVN with eAthena updates.

	* Added Skill Cooldown.
	* Added Freezing Spell + Reading Spellbook.
	* Added new and properly-working Release skill.
	* Added official ball coloring. Still needs more testing. Thanks Pakpil for the packets. :-)
	* Remade Chain Lightning, using official method: Units.
	- It was simpler than we thought. First, we hit a target, which can't be hit twice in a row. If there is nobody to chain to,
		the chain will die. If there IS somebody to chain to, it will chain to that target, and keep going until there is nobody
		else to hit. This depends on the amount of chains available, which is represented by Skill Level + 4.
	- The code is way cleaner. ;D
	* Fixes to Earth Strain:
	- Fixed number of hits.
	- Fixed unit life time and range.
	- Fixed unit spacing. The higher the level, the more spread apart the units will be, affecting a larger area.
	* Added in official Cast Time, Status Duration, Delay, and Self Delay for the following skills:
	- WL_WHITEIMPRISON
	- WL_SOULEXPANSION
	- WL_FROSTMISTY
	- WL_JACKFROST
